## WhatsApp clone using MERN stack

- BEM naming convention used in App.

## Frontend

- FrontEnd build with React.
- firebase used for authentication & hosting

packages used:

- npm install @material-ui/core
- npm install @material-ui/icons

## Backend

- Backend build with NodeJs, Express.js, mongoDB
- hosted on Heroku
- Pusher used for real time database functionality

### Frontend setup
- create separate directory & from terminal;
- git init
- npm init:
  leave packagename, version as is
  you can add description & for entryPoint use server.js as by convention
  
If you go through the process this creates a package.json file

Make some additions to the package.json file:
- add "start": "node server.js" to the scripts object => when it is deployed to Heroku this will start up the server.js file

Install additional packages
- npm i express mongoose
- also add a .gitignore file
and add node_modules to rpevent node_modules folder to also be added to source control

- add  "type": "module", to package.json to get ES6 context and be able to import

If nodemon hasn't been installed yet use the global install command.
- npm i -g nodemon
and start the server via
- nodemon server.js
============

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
